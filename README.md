> Tips

> Play what you’re comfortable with! Players won’t be messing around like they may be in normal play.

> With a 60% win rate you can go infinite in Constructed. While hard, it’s certainly doable for very good players! **(IS THIS WHAT WE TRYING TO TEST)**

>Stick to two main colors unless you really know what you’re doing.

Things to do:
- [ ] Improve the readme.

- [ ] Implement classes.

- [ ] Use match duration to otimize player time. Like if a deck have 60% winning rate and 5 min average match duration is beter than have a 61 deck with 10 min average duration.

- [ ] Use a frontend?
